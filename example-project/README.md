# Example project

## Prerequisites to run this example:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. [Cargo Make](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-make/0.3.54)
3. [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

## Steps to run example

Run both

```bash
cargo make tailwind
```

and

```bash
cargo make trunk
```

and keep them running. Notice that, due to the concurrent aspect of having both processes run at the same time, it might be necessary to refresh the page to get the styles generated by
TailwindCSS.

Your default browser should open with the example.
